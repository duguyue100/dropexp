Sharing files and experiment results from cloud instance is bit not straight forward.

Therefore I create this repo as a temporary plan. The solid plan will be have a good apache web server setup and have a nice interface for storage. Well, I still cannot find a time for doing this.

##Updated Results

+ Comparison of BP and Feedback alignment using MNIST dataset.
+ First MLP network result for SUSY dataset.
